# Scenario

You are a Software Engineer at Megasoft, a brand-new customer of DT One that has just signed the commercial agreement and eager to go live to start re-selling DT One’s Digital Value Products.

The Product Manager at Megasoft would like to explore some ways of offering the services and You have been tasked to develop a POC (front-end is the minimum requirement) that integrates with the DVS API directly and offers users a way to discover and eventually buy products (you don’t have to worry about payments).

# Requirements

A. A user section that discovers and buys products, as well as running promotions.
B. An administrator section that displays Megasoft’s available Balances and Transaction reports.
C. You can use your preferred technology to do this implementation (DT One adopted Vue.Js for its front-end projects).
D. Let’s assume the Product Manage falls in love with your POC, what steps would you take to move it to production?
